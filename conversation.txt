indeed
they want you to filter data from the xml file
but more than that
they want you to create a class that makes it easy for other people to filter data
probably should create something that let's you pick a tag and a value to filter on
actually
catId is not a tag
but the attribute of a tag
so you should filter on tag (+attribute)
I think you also need to make the output flexible
so they can select what to output
in what format
just a product
that some company is selling
composite means put together from parts
or something
composite: made up of several parts or elements.
also
since the file is so large
you might want to take a look at this:

just google on it
I think they'll be impressed if you think about processing the large file efficiently

miroslav [3:08 PM]
Agree. That is very important.

sjoerd [3:10 PM]
brb

miroslav [3:12 PM]
back

sjoerd [3:12 PM]
lol
wrong window
any other questions?

miroslav [3:14 PM]
ok
I must use php xml dom, parser, ...?

sjoerd [3:14 PM]
I would use simplexml
I think
see if it works without errors
if the xml is not valid it won't work
simplxml_load_string

miroslav [3:15 PM]
it should load a xml file?

sjoerd [3:15 PM]
well
you can do simplexml_load_file
or first read the file into a string
and then do simplexml_load_string
doesn't matter :slightly_smiling_face:

miroslav [3:16 PM]
I see. I'll try.
Anything else...

sjoerd [3:16 PM]
nah
just comment
and try to make it reusable
simplexml uses xpath
do you know that?

miroslav [3:17 PM]
I worked on some web data extraction project and used xpath for selecting elements

sjoerd [3:17 PM]
:+1:

miroslav [3:17 PM]
But didn't use xml files but html
I can use xpath in xml?

sjoerd [3:18 PM]
in the simple xml object, yes
http://www.dimuthu.org/blog/2008/09/30/xpath-in-simplexml/

miroslav [3:19 PM]
So the way is the same. Make an xmldom object and manipulate with it in the same way?

sjoerd [3:19 PM]
yes very similar

miroslav [3:19 PM]
Just one more quesition and I won't waist your time more

sjoerd [3:20 PM]
:slightly_smiling_face:
no problem
take your time
let me check
detail xml is another xml file
so I guess he wants to read the out from that as well
output can be in browser or export file, doesn't matter much since it's easy to change
can you open the xml?
hmmm that's true
all he says is 'I want something that's flexible in how it handles each match'
so just write the class to be flexible

miroslav [3:27 PM]
OK

sjoerd [3:27 PM]
no
there is a very large xml file
with thousands of products
catId is probably category ID
so many different products can have the same category ID
then each product has a detail xml file
which is probably a different file for each product
there are several steps
1) read the xml file and get the matches
2) process the matches
step 2 can be just printing like in the example, or step 2 can be processing the detail xml files

miroslav [3:30 PM]
I see.

sjoerd [3:30 PM]
needless to say, but this is just my interpretation :wink:

miroslav [3:31 PM]
You see this line/question?

sjoerd [3:31 PM]
yes
yes
so you can write 2 classes
1) a library for reading (a very large) xml file and find matches
2) a child class that processes the matches, one that is specific for this project
make sure you add some nice and clear error handling
to handle a none existing file input, or invalid xml, or whatever
programmers love that :slightly_smiling_face:

miroslav [3:36 PM]
Hehe yes I know that.
Since this is a naked project I can use official PHP classes for error handling wiht try/catch blocks.

sjoerd [3:37 PM]
indeed
he's saying that someone with less programming skills must be able to use it
in this paragraph he explains what somebody with less programming skills can do

miroslav [3:39 PM]
Aha, I see.
OK. That's all for now.
If you don't mind I wouldn't say good bye for now.
But for the next wee.
I want to finish that code for testing and some more explanations.

sjoerd [3:40 PM]
sure, that'll be great
and let me know if you have any questions about the xml thing

miroslav [3:41 PM]
So if you don't mind I can be active on this channel during the nest week.

sjoerd [3:41 PM]
:+1:

miroslav [3:41 PM]
I'll prepare something for this project and if you want you can look at that next week if you have the time.

sjoerd [3:42 PM]
yes
monday or thursday
tues and wednes I'm at the horse-game-guy

miroslav [3:42 PM]
OK :slightly_smiling_face:

sjoerd [3:42 PM]
ok I need to finish something
ttyl!
and have a good weekend
and thanks for your work :slightly_smiling_face:

miroslav [3:44 PM]
Thanks man. I had very pleasant time with you and other guys during my visit and during the work. I'm sorry there was no chance to come to my country but one never knows :slightly_smiling_face:


sjoerd [3:45 PM]
yeah I regret that too
maybe if I ever get to visit I'll give you a call?

miroslav [3:45 PM]
Yes, it would be great!

sjoerd [3:45 PM]
well, email probably :slightly_smiling_face:
